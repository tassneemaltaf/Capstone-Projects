# Finance Calculators

This was the first capstone project for my bootcamp course. 
My mentor wanted to test my new aqcuired programming skills, so I was challenged to create a simple python program that allows the user to access two different calculators: 

* An investment calculator;
* A home loan repayment calculator.
